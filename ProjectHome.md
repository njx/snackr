### v0.41 release build now available ###
**June 14, 2010**: A release build of Snackr with the updated Google Reader authentication is now available. This build is basically the same as v0.4, with additional support for captchas during GR login. Please check the [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/ReleaseNotes_0_41), try out the [new v0.41 build](http://snackr.googlecode.com/files/Snackr-v0.41.air) and let us know if you see any problems.

### v0.4 test build now available ###
**June 8, 2010**: Google Reader is turning off their original authentication scheme on June 15, so we've updated Snackr to use a different scheme, and made a few small bugfixes to boot. Please check the [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/ReleaseNotes_0_4), try out the [new v0.4 build](http://snackr.googlecode.com/files/Snackr-v0.4.air) and let us know if you see any problems.

### v0.39 "officially" released (finally) ###
**February 15, 2010**: Since v0.39 has been in the wild for over a year and it seems to be working pretty well (and fixes serious bugs in 0.33), I've finally gotten around to putting it up on snackr.net. One of these days I'll have to get back to this thing and actually add new features!

### v0.39 TEST build--candidate for official release ###
**December 15, 2008**: After a long hiatus, I've just posted a new test build, 0.39. There are just a few new features and bugfixes in this release (see the [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/ReleaseNotes_0_39_TEST)), including the much-requested option to remove Snackr from the taskbar on Windows. However, I'd like to promote this to an official build that gets pushed out to all Snackr users through autoupdate.

So, please [back up your database and feed list](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/TestBuildInfo), [download v0.39 TEST](http://snackr.googlecode.com/files/Snackr-v0.39-TEST.air) and check it out! As always, file any issues you find using the issue tracker here on Google Code.

Also, I'm thinking of instituting an "official" beta program for Snackr. The requirements for participation are low--you just have to be willing to get announcement emails every so often, download new test builds as they come out, use them for a few days, and answer a quick survey on how well the build is working for you. If you're interested, please [fill out the beta signup form](http://snackr.wufoo.com/forms/snackr-beta-list-signup/).

### Google Reader integration is here! ###
**July 21, 2008**: A test version with Google Reader integration is here! **[Back up your Snackr database AND your Google Reader feed list](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/TestBuildInfo)**, **[read the release notes](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/ReleaseNotes_0_38_TEST)**, then [download v0.38 TEST](http://snackr.googlecode.com/files/Snackr-v0.38-TEST.air). Thanks to Rob Adams for all his hard work on this.

**NOTE: if you enable Google Reader integration, and you delete a feed in Snackr, it will automatically be deleted in Google Reader as well** (and if you add a feed in Snackr, it will get added to Reader too). We plan to make this optional in the future. (If you downloaded the previous 0.37 build, this build doesn't have any new functionality, but makes the synchronization of feeds between Snackr and Google Reader clearer.)

There are also a few other features, such as the ability to post items to email, del.icious, digg, etc.--and a bunch of bug fixes. See the [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/ReleaseNotes_0_38_TEST) for details.

### What is Snackr? ###
Snackr is an RSS ticker that pulls random items from your feeds and scrolls them across your desktop. When you see a title that looks interesting, you can click on it to pop up the item in a window. The project is owned by Narciso Jaramillo [<nj@snackr.net>](mailto:nj@snackr.net).

Snackr is built using Adobe AIR and Flex. You can hack on Snackr using the free [Adobe Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/#sdk) and [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/tools/sdk/) SDKs, but life will be much easier if you use [Adobe Flex Builder](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex3email), an Eclipse-based IDE for developing Flex applications.

The main Snackr home page is at [http://snackr.net](http://snackr.net); official release builds are posted there. Interim test builds will be posted [here](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/downloads/list) for folks who like to live on the bleeding edge; please read the [notes on test builds](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/wiki/TestBuildInfo) before installing one.

Please file bugs and feature requests using the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/snackr/issues/list), or send me mail at [<nj@snackr.net>](mailto:nj@snackr.net). Thanks!
